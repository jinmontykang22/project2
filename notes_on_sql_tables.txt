I created the following tables:
    ingredients (ing_id INT PKEY, ing_name TEXT, numServings INT),
    inventory (inv_item_id INT PKEY, name TEXT, units_remaining INT, numServings INT),
    items (order_id INT PKEY, product_id INT, item_id TEXT, size TEXT, sugar INT, ice INT, extra_milk INT),
    orders (order_id INT PKEY, day DATE, time TIME, price DECIMAL),
    products (product_id INT PKEY, product_name TEXT, price DECIMAL, temperature TEXT, flavor INT, flavor_2 INT, flavor_3 INT, milk DECIMAL, cream INT, sugar INT),
    staff (name TEXT, id TEXT PKEY, role TEXT, salary INT, hours INT)

these are the headers/attributes in that order per table, with datatype and PKEY if it's the primary key
you may need to adjust queries slightly (column names, table names) as needed

FOR ANY QUERY RELATED TO inventory/ingredients, you may have to combine data from tables 'ingredients' and 'inventory.' 
they were split so that 'ingredients' has the food items related to drinks, while 'inventory' has more generalized items for the shop

check writeALL2.py for additional info on table entries
